Based in Leeds and established in 2015, <a href="https://studentdatalabs.com/">Student Data Labs</a> helped students to gain highly sought-after data skills whilst working on real-world projects. As ex-Founder, I managed the Labs, which offered a collaborative space for students from a variety of academic backgrounds to undertake real-world data projects. Sponsored by the <a href="http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/">Leeds Institute for Data Analytics</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/">Consumer Data Research Centre</a>, we ran Innovation Labs in Leeds and London that focused on <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/HealthInnovationLab">Health</a>, <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/VisionZeroInnovationLab">Vision Zero</a> and <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab">Empty Housing</a>.
