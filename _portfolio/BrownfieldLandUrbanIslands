A project that maps London's brownfield land as 'Urban Islands' using waterlines and coastal vignettes, cartographic techniques for illustrating the motion of water and establishing figure-ground. Brownfields are previously developed sites, often residing unused or underutilised, that can manifest in rapidly growing cities.
