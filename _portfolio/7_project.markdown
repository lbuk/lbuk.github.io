As a Google Fellow at BBC News Labs, I was tasked with exploring how we might build trust in news. This led to the production of an assortment of tools for analysing online news text: <a href="https://github.com/lbuk/SimText_Function">SimText</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lbuk/NewsStat">NewsStat</a>. <a href="https://github.com/lbuk/SimText_Function">SimText</a> measures the similarity between news content. <a href="https://github.com/lbuk/NewsStat">NewsStat</a>, meanwhile, extracts key statistical text from news.
