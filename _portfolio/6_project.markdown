As part of my work at <a href="http://isensing.co.uk/portfolios/chamberi-district-city-of-madrid/">iSensing</a>, an IoT company, I was responsble for analysing movement data from IoT sensors in the Chamberi district of Madrid. The results of the project were presented to planning services to optimise street cleaning in the city. The analysis, which included origin-destination flows maps, was conducted mainly using R, a statistical programming language.
