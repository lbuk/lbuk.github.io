In a previous life I worked in news, specifically data journalism and visual journalism. As a 2016 Google Fellow at BBC News Labs, an innovation incubator at innovation at BBC News, and the Graphics Desk, I produced <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-36913991">data visualisations</a> for breaking news stories, assisted with producing a news application for the Rio Olympics and worked on a project to encourage trust in news. I developed a tool, <a href="https://github.com/lbuk/NewsStat">NewsStat</a>, for extracting key statistical text from online news as part of the Trust Project. While working for <a href="https://www.graphicnews.com/">Graphic News</a>, a news agency specialising in visual journalism, I maintained the news database and assisted with the production of graphics for breaking news.
