I worked for several years in news, most notably at <a href="http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/">BBC News Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.graphicnews.com/">Graphic News</a>.

As a Google Fellow at BBC News Labs in the summer of 2016, an innovation incubator responsible for innovation for BBC News, and the Graphics Desk, I produced data visualisations and worked on a project to encourage trust in news.

Whilst working for Graphic News, a news agency specialising in data visualisation and visual journalism, I maintained the news database and assisted with the production of graphics for breaking news.
