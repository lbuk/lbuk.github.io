I worked for several years in news, most notably at <a href="http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/">BBC News Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.graphicnews.com/">Graphic News</a>.

As a <a href="http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/2016/09/26/google-fellow-liam-bolton-blogs-about-his-time-at-the-bbc/">Google Fellow</a> at BBC News Labs, an innovation incubator responsible for innovation for BBC News, and the Graphics Desk, I produced <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-36913991">data visualisationsgit add --all</a> for breaking news stories, assisted with producing a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/36984887">news application</a> for the Rio Olympics and worked on a project to encourage trust in news in 2016.

Whilst working for Graphic News, a news agency specialising in data visualisation and visual journalism, I maintained the news database and assisted with the production of graphics for breaking news.
