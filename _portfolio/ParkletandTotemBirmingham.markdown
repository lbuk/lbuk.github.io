While working for <a href="http://www.redninja.co.uk/">Red Ninja Studios</a>, a design-led technology company, and <a href="http://isensing.co.uk/">iSensing</a>, an IoT company that provides mobility analytics, I collaborated with <a href="https://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/">Future Cities Catapult</a> on a parklet and tech totem for Birmingham. Installed in October 2017, the parklet provided seating and plants. The totem consisted of a 'mobile lab' with sensors that were used by local businesses. The tech totem also included an on-screen display, wireless connectivity and renewable technology.
