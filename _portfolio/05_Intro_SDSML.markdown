While working as a Postgraduate Teaching Assistant (PGTA) in 2022 on the Urban Design MArch programme at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/bartlett-school-architecture">The Bartlett School of Architecture</a>, I organised several workshops that aimed to provide an introduction to spatial data science and machine learning. The workshop resources have been made open source and were uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/lbuk/UD_Intro_SDSML2022">Github</a>.
