My PhD research, completed at The Bartlett School of Architecture in 2024, focused on techniques for measuring and mapping rooftop housing. I provided a spatial analysis of airspace development in London between 2008/09 and 2018/19. I also developed several techniques as part of my doctoral research such as the <a href="https://www.liamthomasbolton.com/portfolio/FresnelMap/">Fresnel Map</a> and <a href="https://www.liamthomasbolton.com/portfolio/SpaceRatio/">Space Ratio</a>. Here are a selection of maps and charts from my <a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10192942/">thesis</a>.
