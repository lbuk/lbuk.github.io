As part of my job as an Urban Data Analyst at <a href="http://www.redninja.co.uk/">Red Ninja Studios</a>, a design-led technology company, and <a href="http://isensing.co.uk/">iSensing</a>, an IoT company that provides mobility analytics, I produced a number of interactive, shareable maps and visualisations for international stakeholders. The maps aim to improve the deployment of real-time sensors by visualising planning data for clients.
