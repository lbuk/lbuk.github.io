A Department for Transport-funded study that explored how machine learning and big data can be used to model car dependency in West Yorkshire. I produced a short policy report as part of the project. Developed in collaboration with Dr Robin Lovelace at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics. The project can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/Robinlovelace/mlCars">Github</a>.
