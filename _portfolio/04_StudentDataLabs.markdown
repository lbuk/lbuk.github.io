Based in Leeds and established in 2015, <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/">Student Data Labs</a> helped university students to gain highly sought-after data skills while working on real-world projects. The Innovation Labs focused on civic problems like <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab">empty housing</a>, health inequality and Vision Zero. Student Data Labs was sponsored by the <a href="http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/">Leeds Institute for Data Analytics</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/">Consumer Data Research Centre</a>. The Vision Zero Innovation Lab formed part of the 2016 <a href="https://leedsdigitalfestival.org/">Leeds Digital Festival</a>, the largest digital festival in the north of England.
