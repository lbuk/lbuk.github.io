I'm an Urban Data Analyst and MSc student at The Bartlett, University College London. 

Welcome to my portfolio website.

<br/>
<b>Background</b>
<br/>
My background resides at the intersection of data science, design and policy. I'm currently undertaking an MSc Smart Cities and Urban Analytics at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/">Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)</a> at The Bartlett, University College London whilst working part-time as an Urban Data Analyst at <a href="http://www.redninja.co.uk/">Red Ninja Studios</a>, a design-led technology company, and <a href="http://isensing.co.uk/">iSensing</a>, a company that provides IoT and mobility analytics. Specialising in data visualisation and GIS, I'm highly skilled with R, QGIS and Tableau. I'm also skilled with Python and MySQL as well as text mining and machine learning methods.

During 2017 I was funded by the Department for Transport to explore how machine learning and big data can be used to model car dependency in West Yorkshire. In 2016 I was awarded a <a href="http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/2016/09/26/google-fellow-liam-bolton-blogs-about-his-time-at-the-bbc/">Google Fellowship</a> at <a href="http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/">BBC News Labs</a>. At the BBC I contributed to data-driven stories, helped with the production of news applications and worked on a project to encourage trust in news. I have also worked on data-driven projects at the <a href="leeds.theodi.org">Leeds Node of the Open Data Institute (ODI)</a>, <a href="https://www.graphicnews.com/">Graphic News</a>, a news agency specialising in infographics and data visualisation, the <a href="http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/">Leeds Institute for Data Analytics</a> and the <a href="http://www.rgs.org/HomePage.htm">Royal Geographical Society</a>. As ex-Founder of <a href="https://studentdatalabs.com/">Student Data Labs</a>, I have managed data-driven innovation labs that aim to tackle problems like <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/">empty housing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/VisionZeroInnovationLab/">road casualties</a> whilst teaching practical data skills to university students. I have given talks on data science and cities at the Government Digital Service, the Department for Transport and the launch of the Leeds City Dashboard.
